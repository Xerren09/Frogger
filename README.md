# Frogger

Remake of the famous 1981 Konami game, written in JavaScript, built on my simple videogame engine, [EntityEngine](https://github.com/Xerren09/EntityEngine).

This was a first year (3rd term final) assignment for OAMK's Object Oriented Browser Programming University Module.

##### The goal of the project

The project's goal was to only recreate the game itself, however since I already had scraps of a videogame engine I decided to finally stitch that together and build the game on it, since it only took a few tweaks of the underlying supporting system to turn them into a separate engine.

The requirements were to implement basic gameplay features such as cars, logs and turtles and animate them as they would behave in the original game.

Additional features (like crocodiles, flies) were left out from this version since it would have taken too long to recreate the full game in the given timeframe.
